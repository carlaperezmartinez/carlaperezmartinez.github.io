Aydin gave a talk on "Optimisation of Charged Particle Optics with the Differential Algebra Method" and Shaun presented a poster on "Ion Implantation into Semiconductors using Ionic Liquid Ion Sources" at the meeting of the European FIB Network in Valencia, Spain, in September 2025. We had a great time and an epic paella.
