Carla Perez Martinez is a UKRI Future Leaders Fellow at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at University College London. Carla obtained her BS, MS and PhD degrees from MIT in 2011, 2013 and 2016, respectively. For her undergraduate and graduate research, Carla worked with Prof Paulo Lozano in the MIT Space Propulsion Lab, developing ionic liquid ion sources. After her PhD, she moved to the UK to take up a postdoctoral position in the group of Prof Susan Perkin in the Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford, where she was also appointed Junior Research Fellow at Trinity College. At Oxford, Carla studied ionic liquids and electrolytes under nanoconfinement, in particular, the response of these substances when subjected to electric fields. In January 2020, Carla moved to the London Centre for Nanotechnology with funding from UKRI to set up her own group, to develop new nanomanufacturing technologies based on ionic liquid ion sources.
