Dr Aydin Sabouri received his PhD degree from the Micro Engineering and Nanotechnology Centre at the University of Birmingham in 2015. His doctoral work was on development of a novel detector for measuring the beam and its halo in focused ion beam systems. He also investigated the ion-solid interactions and the effect of ion implantation on substrates.

Following his PhD, he has been working as a research fellow at the same university and has been researching novel micro and nano manufacturing processes for NEMS and optical devices. He was a recipient of an EPSRC award (£59k), titled “Innovative Manufacturing in Laser-based Production Processes,” to develop a biosensor for the rapid detection of proteins for healthcare applications. Following this, he has worked on the design, fabrication and characterization of novel bio-membranes for use in spectroscopic interrogation of lipid bilayers and monitoring of trans-membrane processes. He was also the manager of the cleanroom facility and supervised micro and nanofabrication research.

Aydin’s postdoctoral work will develop a new focused ion beam system based on ionic liquids.
