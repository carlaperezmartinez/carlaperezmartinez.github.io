Alexander Storey is a fourth-year PhD student at the London Centre for Nanotechnology at University College London. He received his MSci in Chemistry from UCL in 2019. His Masters dissertation involved simulation of ion-atom collisions in the femtosecond resolution, in an attempt to describe an unexplained behaviour previously observed experimentally during the collision of certain states of Ar2+ and He. In September 2021, Alex joined the Ionic Liquids for Nanomanufacturing research group as part of UCL Physics, where his work will involve the design, simulation, construction and implementation of a Wien filter as a means to separate different ion species in ILIS technology. His research will also involve the irradiation of various substrates using ILIS and evaluating their effectiveness compared to existing techniques.
